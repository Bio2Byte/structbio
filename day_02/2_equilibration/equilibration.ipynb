    "* Atoms to be simulated\n",
    "* Coordinates of these atoms\n",
    "* Connectivity (bonds between the atoms)\n",
    "* Parameters to simulate non-bonded interactions (electrostatic & van-der-Waals interactions )\n",

    "Before, we start the simulation, lets recapitulate some basics.\n",
    "The simulation process is carried out in time steps, where each time step corresponds to the passing of a tiny amount of time, $(dt = 2 \\cdot 10^{-15} s)$.\n",
    "During the simulation, each particle has a velocity assigned $(\\vec{v})$.\n",
    "At the beginning of each **time step** ($dt$), the direction an magnitude of $\\vec{v}$ gets updated according to the forces acting on the particle (*e.g.*, bonds, neighboring particles, ...). Then, the particle is moved along $\\vec{v}$ for $dt$.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, none of the atoms in the system have a velocity. THey are perfectly motionless (comparable to bein \"frozen\" at 0 K). Therefore, we need to \"heat\" the system up, to get the particles to move at a **physiological temperature**. With increasing the temprature the pressure inside the periodic boundary box will rise. So, we will finally adjust the size of the box, to maintain a **constant pressure** at 1 atm."
